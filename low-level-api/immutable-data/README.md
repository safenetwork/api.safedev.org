# Immutable Data API

Immutable data is written to and read from the SAFE Network via [self-encryption](https://safenetwork.wiki/en/Security_-_Self_encryption). Once created, it canâ€™t be edited by anyone.

See the [self_encryption crate](https://github.com/maidsafe/self_encryption) for more details.
