# Immutable Data API

Immutable data is written to and read from the SAFE Network using a process called "self-encryption". Data is split into chunks, randomized, encrypted and stored across several nodes on the SAFE Network.

Once created, immutable data canâ€™t be edited by anyone.

See the [self_encryption crate](https://github.com/maidsafe/self_encryption) for more details.
