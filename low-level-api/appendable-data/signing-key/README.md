# Signing Key API

This API provides the ability to obtain a signing key handle representing the public signing key of the current user. This can be useful when creating an appendable data with a `WHITE_LIST` filter. For example, you might want to add the signing key of the current user to the filter of the appendable data. That way, the current user will be able to append data to the appendable data.
